# What Could Go Wrong - LLM Edition

This repository hosts the files used for the What Could Go Wrong? digital card game. Nikolas Martelaro and Wendy Ju developed and presented the game at a Workshop at AutoUI 2020. The game was then modified by Nik and his team at CMU to be more generalized for AI-based systems.

The version here presents a further iteration on the game. In this iteration, prompts focus on applications of large language models. Example applications are drawn from two sources: Kaddour et al.(2023) and FlowGPT.com. The list of potential ethical issues stems from the AI4People framework (Floridi et al., 2021) and a business ethics enumeration (Baker and Comer, 2012). Besides, this iteration of the game includes a LaTeX template, which can be used to convert the digital card game into a physical card game. 

The digital card game can be loaded into and played on PlayingCards.io. Custom cards can be added using the `csv` files for `prompts` and `responses`

## Abstract
While autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly improve our daily lives, there are also challenges and potential downsides to these systems. In this workshop, we intend to foster discussions about the potential negative aspects of autonomous cars in hopes of surfacing challenges that should be considered during the design process rather than after deployment. We will spur these conversations through a review of participant position statements and through group discussion facilitated by a card game called “What Could Go Wrong?” Our goal is to consider the autonomous vehicle’s benefits—improving safety, increasing mobility, reducing emissions—against potential drawbacks. By identifying potential harms and downsides, the workshop attendees, and the AutoUI community more broadly can design well-considered solutions.


## Revised Gameplay Instructions:

### Setup:  
•	All players draw 5 white cards from their stack. Include wildcard and power cards in the deck to add strategic depth.  
•	Use a spinner to select the first Card Czar randomly.  

### Gameplay:  
1.	The Card Czar Role:  
•	The Card Czar draws a black prompt card and reads it aloud.  
•	For themed rounds, the Card Czar announces the theme before drawing the prompt card.  
2.	Player Response:  
•	Players choose a white response card from their hand, considering the use of wildcard and power cards strategically. Power cards can be played alongside a response card for effects like swapping hands or peeking at the next prompt.  
•	In speed rounds, players have a limited time to choose their card.  
3.	Revealing Responses:  
•	The Card Czar reads each response aloud. For creative storytelling or debate rounds, players briefly elaborate on or defend their chosen card.  
4.	Selection and Scoring:  
•	The Card Czar selects the winning card. The player whose card was chosen receives 1 point.  
•	Bonus points are awarded for unanimous selections or if a player wins consecutive rounds.  
•	Players can earn additional points during debate rounds by providing compelling arguments for their cards.  
5.	Discussion and Further Exploration:  
•	The group discusses the chosen card and its implications, awarding extra points for insightful or humorous contributions.  
•	Achievements can be awarded during this time for fulfilling specific criteria (e.g., winning with a wildcard).  
6.	Proceeding to the Next Round:  
•	The role of Card Czar rotates. Each player draws a new white card, ensuring they always have 5 cards in their hand.  
•	Power cards are replenished at the discretion of the game's rules to maintain balance.  

### End of Game:  
•	The game ends either after a predetermined number of rounds or when a player reaches a set number of points.  
•	Players can share their favorite moments or cards from the game, reinforcing the social and reflective aspects of the gameplay.
